title: Programming the Right Way
---

There seems to be an increasing number of students with programming experience enrolling at the <a href="http://turing.io/">Turing School
of Software &amp; Design</a>. In their short history, these types of programs have traditionally been geared toward
people with little to no programming experience. You might ask, "why would an experienced programmer enroll in a program like Turing?" It's not
cheap, and you don't have time to work during the 7 month intensive program. Therefore, your
total cost including tuition and lost income is quite significant.

## My Background
My background includes a Bachelor degree in Management Information Systems plus
10 years of experience in web development, IT consulting, and software
engineering. That may sound like a lot, but skills fade quickly when you don't
use them regularly. At least they do for me. Not to mention, in a field like programming, the frameworks, tools, and methodologies change dramatically in a short timespan.

While I've been exposed to a lot of different languages, tools, and experiences,
virtually all of my professional programming experience has been in more
traditional corporate
environments. Even Yahoo! was a very traditionally run corporate dot-com
company when I was a web developer there back in 2000. Sure, it had the colorful Yahoo! colored cubicles, the foosball tables,
the cafe, and the cool industrial warehouse office vibe, but when it came down to it,
it was just another traditionally run corporation. Even my most recent programming job was
with a large web development company that specialized in the financial industry.
The bottom line is most of my experience was in traditional corporate
environments. Therefore, I was rarely exposed to the open source community and
modern
methodologies. I was scarcely aware that a passionate programmer community like the Ruby on Rails one even existed. I
was more often than not surrounded by more traditional thinking business people and
programmers using proprietary technology stacks and old school methodologies.

I did not
want to go back into that type of environment. In fact, I was offered a high paying software engineering job last year despite the fact that I had been out of the game for a few years. I turned it down. I would have been working for a traditional minded company consulting for traditional corporations using a proprietary Microsoft stack again. It didn't matter how much they paid. If I was going to go back into software engineering, I was going to do it right this time.

## Programming the Right Way
That brings me back to Turing School. After much research, I determined that
despite the significant cost in both time and money, Turing School  was my best
bet for being the best programmer I could be and getting back into the programming industry *the right way*.

What is *the right way*? In my mind, the right way involves the following:

- working with open source languages, frameworks, and tools
- being a part of the open source community
- being part of a passionate programming community (such as the Ruby on Rails one)
- using modern methodologies including Agile development, pair programming, and TDD
- working with and for companies that value continuous learning and development
- working with and for companies that foster culture and an entrepreneurial spirit

In fact, the first book I read at Turing School
sums up much of how I view my renewed passion for and commitment to the right kind of programming career. If
you haven't already, I recommend reading <a

Fowler.
