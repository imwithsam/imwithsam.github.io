Greetings!

My name is Samson Brock, and this is badMOTIVATOR.io. (badMOTIVATOR was my
[Battle.net](http://battle.net/), and pre-Battle.net, handle way back when I
started playing Warcraft and Starcraft on the Undergraduate Library computers at
the University of Texas at Austin.) This blog was started on June 6th, 2015, to
journal my re-entry into the world of professional software engineering.

At that time, I already had about 10 years of combined professional experience
across software engineering, IT consulting, and web development roles. It had,
however, been a few years since I had programmed professionally. Technology and
methodology change, and skills rust quickly. Never one to do things half-assed,
I chose to enroll in [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io/)'s
7-month intensive Web Application Development Program. 

Currently, I am a "Test Driven Web Developer" with [Carbon
Five](http://www.carbonfive.com/). 

Please feel free to contact me through any of my accounts linked in the footer
of this site.

Cheers!
